## Data Sources

The platform utilizes two primary data sources:

- Free to use, no API key required
- Supports multiple cryptocurrencies
- Located in `client/src/lib/price-service.ts`
- Default supported symbols: BTC, ETH, DOGE, SOL, DOT, ADA, MATIC, LINK, UNI, AVAX

### 2. Exchange API (Trading Execution)
By default, the platform uses Coinbase, but you can easily integrate other exchanges:

#### Default: Coinbase Integration
1. Create a Coinbase API key with trading permissions
2. Update your `.env`:
```env
COINBASE_API_KEY=your_coinbase_api_key
COINBASE_API_SECRET=your_coinbase_secret
```

#### Alternative Exchange Integration
You can modify `server/coinbase-service.ts` to use a different exchange:

##### Binance Integration Example
1. Install Binance API package:
```bash
npm install binance-api-node
```

2. Update your `.env`:
```env
EXCHANGE_TYPE=binance
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_secret
```

3. Update the exchange service configuration in `server/coinbase-service.ts`:
```typescript
import { Binance } from 'binance-api-node';

export const exchange = new Binance({
  apiKey: process.env.BINANCE_API_KEY,
  apiSecret: process.env.BINANCE_API_SECRET,
});
```

##### Other Supported Exchanges
- KuCoin
- Kraken
- Bitfinex
- FTX

   - Never commit API keys to version control

2. Paper Trading:
   - Always test strategies in paper trading mode first
   - Validate strategy performance before live trading
   - Monitor risk metrics carefully
